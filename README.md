# Algorithm-Threshold-Combination
An effective method of improving algorithm fairness
1. Provided demonstration of discriminated tendency of COMPAS (following ProPublica, but only includes sample of African-American and Caucasian for simplicity).
2. Proved the ineffectiveness of sensitive attribute removal.
3. Proved the effectiveness of separating threholds by race. Found the optimal threshold combination (6, 4), which increases both fairness and accuracy of the models.
The effectiveness is test by 3 algorithms(Neural Network, SVM, and Random Forest) and distributional impact.
